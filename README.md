# TOCSVANDBEYOND
a super simple pdf to csv conversion program. One works with tabula and requires jvm to run (test.py) and the other works with pdf plumber and only uses python libraries (test_pure_python.py).

just select a file using the browse button,
type in a name that you wish to save it as in the small text box,
it will save the new csv to the same directory of the original file.
